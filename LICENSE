GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.

0. Additional Definitions.

As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
General Public License.

"The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.

An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
of using an interface provided by the Library.

A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
Version".

The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.

The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.

1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.

2. Conveying this License.

You may convey a copy of this License along with every copy of the
Library, and you may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice,
provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the
customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging such
modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered
by this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the
Combined Work during execution displays copyright notices, you must
include the copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a
reference directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you
must do one of these things:

a) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the Library's complete
source code, which must be conveyed under the terms of sections 1-6
of this License.

b) Give prominent notice with the Combined Work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License,
and provide instructions for obtaining a copy of the Library's source
code from a network server at no charge.

c) Convey the Combined Work with a copy of the Library's source code
on durable physical medium customarily used for software interchange.

All rights in the Combined Work which are not expressly granted
under this License are reserved.

This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
origin of the Library and reproducing the content of the copyright notice.

THE LIBRARY IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
